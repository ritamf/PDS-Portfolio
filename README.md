# PDS - Software Design and Patterns

This repository contains the assignments done for the [Software Design and Patterns](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12275) course. It also contains a collection of patterns developed while learning them, and a simple script that kept me motivated for the theoretical exam of the course, inspired by [Patterns Quiz](http://www.vincehuston.org/dp/patterns_quiz.html).
